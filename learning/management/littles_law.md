# Little's Law

Little's Law is a theorem in queuing theory that relates the average number of items in a queue (L), the average waiting time of an item in the queue (W), and the rate at which items arrive and leave the queue (λ).

The formula for Little's Law is:

`L = λW`

Little's Law is widely used also in body shops to control the flow of the production (they usually say that they have to always have 10 cars on the shop to deliver two cars daily).
