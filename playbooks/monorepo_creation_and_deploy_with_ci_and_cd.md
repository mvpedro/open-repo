### Installing T3 Stack
- Open up terminal
	- `npm create t3-app@latest app-name`
		- Write your app name at `app-name`
	- Pick your options, I'd personally would go with:
		- TypeScript
		- All (nextAuth, prisma, tailwind, trpc)
	- Also, create a new repo from this
	- Run `npm install`
	- Commit initial files
		- `git add --all`
		- `git commit -m 'initial commit'`
### Deploying on Railway

	- Login
